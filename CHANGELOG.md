# Changelog

## [0.11.0] - 2026-06-24

### Improvements

- **Connections moved into the settings sidebar** — your saved Kimai connections are now listed directly in the settings sidebar, each showing its name, URL and an indicator for the active connection. Click a connection to jump straight to editing it
- **Refined issue integration settings layout** — reorganized the Integrations settings for a cleaner, easier-to-scan layout

## [0.10.0] - 2026-06-24

### New Features

- **Gitea issue integration** — link Gitea issues to your time entries alongside the existing GitLab and GitHub providers. Supports issue search, open/all state and assignee filtering, include/exclude label filters, and **spent-time sync** to the linked issue when the timer stops (Gitea's native time-tracking endpoint), mirroring the GitLab integration
- **macOS True Tray mode** — hide the app from the Dock and Cmd+Tab so KimaiTray lives purely in the menu bar

### Improvements

- **Pick the project / repository from a list** — instead of typing the project path or repo by hand, load and search the projects/repositories your token can access (GitLab projects, GitHub & Gitea repos) and pick one; manual entry is still available as a fallback. The settings field is now the **default repository**, and the new-timer form has its own repository picker so you can browse another repo's issues per timer without changing the default
- **Pick the connection to configure directly in Integrations settings** — a connection picker (as tabs) at the top of the Integrations section lets you edit any connection's issue-integration settings without first switching the active connection elsewhere; the active connection is marked
- **API version shown per integration provider** — the Integrations settings now display which API version each provider targets (GitLab v4, GitHub REST v3, Gitea v1) under the provider selector
- **Issue integration requests now go through the native HTTP layer** — GitLab, GitHub and Gitea API calls are routed via the Tauri HTTP plugin instead of the webview's `fetch`, so they are no longer subject to browser CORS restrictions. This fixes "Connection failed" against self-hosted instances (e.g. a local Gitea at `http://localhost:3000`) that don't send permissive CORS headers

## [0.9.0] - 2026-06-17

### New Features

- **Pick tags from existing Kimai tags** — the tag field is now a searchable select that lists the tags already defined in Kimai, complete with their colors, and supports adding multiple tags. Kimai only attaches tags that already exist, so picking from the list ensures the tags actually stick
- **Per-connection favorites** — favorite tasks are now scoped to the active connection instead of being shared globally; existing favorites are migrated onto the current connection on first launch
- **Test settings section** — a new section with a tool to move favorites from one connection to another (handy when migrating to a new Kimai server)
- **Refresh button in the New Task form** — reloads the projects, activities and tags lists on demand

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed elapsed time calculation on macOS** — Kimai serializes timezone offsets without a colon (e.g. `+0200`), which the macOS webview did not parse reliably; datetimes are now normalized so the elapsed time is correct
- **Fixed UI jumping when deleting a recent task** — the delete confirmation now keeps the row's original height instead of collapsing to a single line

## [0.8.2] - 2026-06-17

### Improvements

- **Changed the default language to English** — fresh installs without a saved language preference now start in English instead of Slovak

### Documentation

- **Added a download section to the README** — release badges and a prominent link to the [releases page](https://github.com/Engazan/KimaiTray/releases) at the top
- **Corrected the README** — fixed the CI/CD trigger description (runs on version tags and manual dispatch, not on push/PR) and filled in missing entries in the project structure

## [0.8.1] - 2026-06-15

### Bug Fixes

- **Completed the KimaiMate → KimaiTray rename** — fixed the bundle identifier (`eu.engazan.kimaimate` → `eu.engazan.kimaitray`), the window title and the About links so the app, its data directory and its resources are consistently named KimaiTray. Existing settings, API tokens, favorites, hidden tasks and paused timers are migrated automatically on first launch after updating, so no data is lost
- **Fixed Recent/Today tab bar background in transparent theme** — replaced the opaque white background with frosted glass so macOS vibrancy shows through instead of a solid bar
- **Updated the application icon** — new icon with proper macOS safe-area padding so it no longer renders oversized in the Dock and the app switcher

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-12

### New Features

- **Configurable Linux popup monitor placement** — added tray popup settings for choosing the active monitor or a specific monitor, with corner/center placement options

### Improvements

- **README preview image** — added an application preview image to the README

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed custom start time picker clipping** — rendered the date/time picker as an overlay so it stays usable inside constrained popup layouts — thanks to [@4713n](https://github.com/4713n) ([#4](https://github.com/Engazan/KimaiTray/pull/4))
- **Fixed tray content accessibility with multiple paused timers** — made the timer area scroll independently so recent tasks and today entries remain reachable — thanks to [@4713n](https://github.com/4713n) ([#5](https://github.com/Engazan/KimaiTray/pull/5))
- **Fixed idle dialog refresh after stopping timers** — invalidated timesheet cache after idle-dialog stop/discard actions and guarded dialog display when no Kimai client is available

### Translations

- Added popup monitor placement translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.7.2] - 2026-05-28

### New Features

- **Paused timer description hover** — new setting to show the timer description as a tooltip when hovering over a paused timer

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed elapsed timer freezing on Linux** — prevented elapsed timer from freezing in detached mode on Linux

## [0.7.1] - 2026-05-27

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed Windows build warning** — gated macOS-only vibrancy static behind `cfg(target_os = "macos")` to silence unused import warning on Windows builds

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-27

### New Features

- **Auto-insert issue URL** — new toggle in integration settings to automatically add the issue URL to the timer description when selecting an issue in the new task form
- **Timer card animations** — smooth slide-in/fade entry and exit animations on active timer, paused timer, and empty state cards (respects "reduce visual effects" setting)

### Bug Fixes

- **Reduced popup flickering** — position the popup window before showing instead of show-then-reposition, eliminating the visible flash on open
- **Batched query invalidation** — consolidated triple `invalidateQueries` calls into a single predicate-based invalidation across all hooks to reduce cascading re-renders
- **Skipped redundant native calls** — `useAppearance` now caches previous values and skips unchanged `setPopupSize`/`setPopupVibrancy`/`setPopupCornerRadius`/`setDisplayMode` calls
- **Fixed horizontal scroll in new task form** — prevented overflow when selecting an issue with a long title in the issue picker

### Translations

- Added auto-insert URL translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-26

### New Features

- **Favorites** — mark any recent task as a favorite with the star icon for one-click timer start; favorites are persisted locally and shown in a dedicated section above recent tasks across all popup layouts (classic, focus, taskbar, timeline)

### Translations

- Added favorites translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.5.2] - 2026-05-21

### Bug Fixes

- **Fixed "Verification failed" when starting from recent** — active timesheets are now fetched from the server before starting a new timer, eliminating race conditions caused by stale cached state
- **Notes and tags copied from recent entries** — description and tags are now carried over when restarting a timer from the recent tasks list

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-21

### Improvements

- **Label filter always visible** — the "Filter by labels" field is now always shown in integration settings (disabled with a hint until connection is tested and labels are loaded)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-21

### New Features

- **Label filter for issues** — filter issues by labels from your GitLab or GitHub project; available labels are fetched automatically after a successful connection test and displayed as colored, toggleable chips in the integration settings

### Translations

- Added label filter translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate "Recent" heading in the tray popup — thanks to [@4713n](https://github.com/4713n) for the contribution ([#1](https://github.com/engazan/KimaiTray/pull/1))

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-20

### New Features

- **Issue Integration** — optional GitLab/GitHub issue linking when starting timers, with searchable issue picker, per-connection configuration, and action buttons (open in browser, add URL/title to description, copy URL)
- **GitLab Time Sync** — automatically log spent time to the linked GitLab issue when the Kimai timer stops
- **Assigned to me filter** — toggle to show only issues assigned to the authenticated user
- **Issue link in active timer** — when the timer description contains an integration URL, a quick-open button appears next to the description

### Translations

- Added full integration translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-20

### New Features

- **Configurable tray click actions** — left and right click behavior can now be set independently in General settings (toggle popup or do nothing for left; context menu or toggle popup for right); useful for Linux users where left click may not work

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed excessive empty space above and below active timer in Focus layout (removed forced `min-height` and vertical centering from timer area)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed tray icon click handling on Linux — platform-specific code paths for tray events (Linux lacks `MouseButtonState`, so click is handled without button state matching)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### New Features

- **Popup Layout Settings** — 4 configurable layout options: Classic, Focus, Taskbar, Timeline
- **UI Size Setting** — choose between Small, Default, and Large popup size (replaces compact toggle)
