# Changelog

## [0.5.1] - 2026-05-21

### Improvements

- **Label filter always visible** — the "Filter by labels" field is now always shown in integration settings (disabled with a hint until connection is tested and labels are loaded)

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-21

### New Features

- **Label filter for issues** — filter issues by labels from your GitLab or GitHub project; available labels are fetched automatically after a successful connection test and displayed as colored, toggleable chips in the integration settings

### Translations

- Added label filter translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.4.1] - 2026-05-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed duplicate "Recent" heading in the tray popup — thanks to [@4713n](https://github.com/4713n) for the contribution ([#1](https://github.com/engazan/KimaiTray/pull/1))

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-20

### New Features

- **Issue Integration** — optional GitLab/GitHub issue linking when starting timers, with searchable issue picker, per-connection configuration, and action buttons (open in browser, add URL/title to description, copy URL)
- **GitLab Time Sync** — automatically log spent time to the linked GitLab issue when the Kimai timer stops
- **Assigned to me filter** — toggle to show only issues assigned to the authenticated user
- **Issue link in active timer** — when the timer description contains an integration URL, a quick-open button appears next to the description

### Translations

- Added full integration translations for EN, SK, CS, DE, UK

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-20

### New Features

- **Configurable tray click actions** — left and right click behavior can now be set independently in General settings (toggle popup or do nothing for left; context menu or toggle popup for right); useful for Linux users where left click may not work

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed excessive empty space above and below active timer in Focus layout (removed forced `min-height` and vertical centering from timer area)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-20

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed tray icon click handling on Linux — platform-specific code paths for tray events (Linux lacks `MouseButtonState`, so click is handled without button state matching)

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-19

### New Features

- **Popup Layout Settings** — 4 configurable layout options: Classic, Focus, Taskbar, Timeline
- **UI Size Setting** — choose between Small, Default, and Large popup size (replaces compact toggle)
- **Feature Toggles** — enable/disable note, tags, customer filter, and custom start time from Settings
- **Global Keyboard Shortcuts** — configurable hotkeys with shortcut hints in tray menu
- **Update Settings** — auto-update toggle and manual "Check for Updates" button

- **About Section Links** — GitHub repository and issue tracker links in About
